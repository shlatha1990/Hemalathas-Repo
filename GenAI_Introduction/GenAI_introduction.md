# Generative AI: Introduction Notes

## **What is Generative AI?**
Generative AI is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on creating new content, such as text, images, music, and code, by learning patterns from existing data.

### **Key Features**:
1. Generates new, human-like outputs.
2. Learns from patterns in existing data (training datasets).
3. Examples: Text generation (ChatGPT), image creation (DALL-E, Stable Diffusion), music composition, and more.

## **How Does Generative AI Work?**
Generative AI models are built using machine learning and deep learning techniques, particularly with **neural networks**.

### **Key Concepts**:
1. **Training Data**:
   - Models are trained on large datasets (e.g., text, images, or audio).
   - Example: GPT is trained on billions of text documents.

2. **Neural Networks**:
   - A type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain.
   - Key types:
     - Feedforward Neural Networks
     - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
     - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
     - Transformers (most popular for Generative AI).

3. **Pre-Trained Models**:
   - Models like GPT or BERT are pre-trained on massive datasets and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.

4. **Transformer Architecture**:
   - A breakthrough in AI that enables efficient learning from sequential data.
   - Core concepts:
     - Attention Mechanism: Helps models focus on the most relevant parts of input data.
     - Examples: GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).
