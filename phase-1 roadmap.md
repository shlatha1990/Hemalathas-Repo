## Week 4: Introduction to Generative AI Models

### **Goal 1: Learn About Pre-trained Models**
- Explore common generative AI models like GPT, BERT, and Stable Diffusion.
- Learn the differences between them and their use cases.
- Resources:
  - [Hugging Face Course](https://huggingface.co/course).

### **Goal 2: Experiment with Pre-trained Models**
- Use Hugging Face Transformers to generate text or summarize documents.
- Run a simple fine-tuning task (e.g., customize GPT for a specific dataset).
- Resources:
  - Hugging Face Documentation.

## Deliverables for Phase 1:
1. Write a summary of Generative AI basics.
2. Create a small ML project using Scikit-learn (e.g., predict house prices).
3. Train a basic neural network on MNIST using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
4. Fine-tune a pre-trained Hugging Face model for a simple task (e.g., text generation).

**Note:**
- Allocate 1-2 hours daily to stay consistent.
- Keep experimenting and asking questions to clarify doubts.
- Reach out for support when stuck.
