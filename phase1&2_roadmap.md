# Roadmap for Becoming a Lead Generative AI Engineer

## Phase 1: Build Generative AI Fundamentals

### 1. Complete the Databricks "Generative AI Fundamentals" Program
- **Objective:** Gain foundational knowledge of generative AI and practical experience with Databricks.
- **Action Steps:**
  1. Enroll in the program using your partner access to Databricks.
  2. Complete all modules and practical labs, focusing on:
     - Understanding transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs).
     - Training, fine-tuning, and deploying generative models using Databricks.
     - Using Databricks\u2019 ML Runtime for distributed training.
  3. Take notes and document key learnings in a personal knowledge base (e.g., Notion, OneNote).
- **Deliverables:**
  - Program certificate (if offered).
  - A completed lab or project that uses Databricks for generative AI (e.g., fine-tuning GPT).

### 2. Learn AI and Deep Learning Basics
- **Objective:** Build a strong theoretical and practical foundation in machine learning and deep learning.
- **Resources:**
  - **Courses:**
    - [Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
    - Hugging Face\u2019s [Transformers Course](https://huggingface.co/course).
  - **Books:**
    - *Deep Learning* by Ian Goodfellow (optional, for deeper understanding).
- **Topics to Focus On:**
  - Machine Learning Fundamentals: Regression, classification, and clustering.
  - Neural Networks: Feedforward, backpropagation, and optimization.
  - Deep Learning: CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers.
  - Overfitting and regularization techniques.
- **Action Steps:**
  1. Dedicate 1-2 hours daily to the courses and complete all assignments.
  2. Implement simple models in Python to reinforce learning (e.g., using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch).
  3. Participate in Kaggle\u2019s beginner-friendly competitions to apply ML skills.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Certificates of completion from courses.
  - A personal repository of ML/DL projects (e.g., GitHub).

### 3. Programming and AI Frameworks

- **Tools to Learn:**
  - **Programming Language:** Python (focus on NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data processing).
  - **AI Frameworks:** PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers.
  - **Databricks-Specific Tools:** Databricks Notebooks and MLflow.
- **Action Steps:**
  1. Complete introductory tutorials for PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers.
  2. Recreate simple projects:
     - Build a sentiment analysis model using Hugging Face Transformers.
     - Fine-tune a pre-trained GPT model on a small dataset.
  3. Explore Databricks-specific integrations, such as:
     - Using MLflow to track model experiments.
     - Running distributed PyTorch training on Databricks clusters.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Simple, completed projects demonstrating proficiency in AI frameworks.
  - A Hugging Face model fine-tuned on a custom dataset.

## Phase 2: Strengthen Data and AI Integration

### 4. Leverage Your Data Engineering Expertise
- **Objective:** Use your data engineering skills to prepare and manage training data for generative AI models.
- **Action Steps:**
  1. Design ETL pipelines for AI datasets:
     - Use Apache Spark (on Databricks) to preprocess and clean large datasets.
     - Leverage Databricks Delta Lake for efficient data storage and versioning.
  2. Practice creating data pipelines for:
     - Text data (e.g., web scraping and cleaning for NLP tasks).
     - Image data (e.g., organizing datasets for GANs or diffusion models).
  3. Experiment with distributed training using Databricks clusters to handle large-scale datasets.
- **Deliverables:**
  - A robust ETL pipeline for generative AI training data.
  - Documentation of data engineering workflows for AI.

### 5. MLOps for Generative AI
- **Objective:** Develop pipelines for deploying and maintaining generative AI models in production.
- **Tools to Learn:**
  - MLflow (native in Databricks) for experiment tracking and deployment.
  - Docker and Kubernetes for model containerization and scaling.
  - CI/CD tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions for automated workflows.
- **Action Steps:**
  1. Learn the basics of Docker and Kubernetes for deploying AI models.
  2. Set up an end-to-end pipeline:
     - Train a generative AI model (e.g., fine-tune GPT).
     - Deploy the model using MLflow.\n
     - Automate retraining and redeployment with CI/CD.
  3. Monitor model performance and implement feedback loops for improvement.
- **Deliverables:**
  - A deployed generative AI model accessible via API.
  - Documentation of the MLOps pipeline.

## Recommended Timeline for Phases 1 and 2
- **Phase 1:** 2-3 months (with consistent daily effort).
- **Phase 2:** 2-3 months (focused on integration and MLOps).

By the end of these phases, you will have a solid foundation in generative AI and practical experience in building, deploying, and managing models.
